title: "Quickstart: First Live Stream"
description: "Create your first live stream, push RTMP from an encoder, and test playback using the Videograph Live Stream API."
---

## Overview

This quickstart walks you through creating a live stream, sending RTMP from an encoder, and obtaining a playback URL. Videograph supports low-latency live streaming over RTMP and can optionally record the live session to produce an on-demand asset.

## Prerequisites

- A Videograph account. See [Introduction to Videograph](/introduction).
- An API key with permission to create live streams. See [Authentication & Authorization](/authentication).
- An RTMP-compatible encoder such as OBS, vMix, or a hardware encoder.

## Create and publish your first live stream

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a live stream via API" icon="terminal">

    Use the Videograph API to create a new live stream.  
    The minimal request includes `title`, `region`, and `record`.

    <CodeGroup tabs="curl">
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/livestreams" \
  -u "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY:YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My First Live Stream",
    "region": "in",
    "record": true
  }'
```
    </CodeGroup>

    A successful response contains values such as `playbackUrl`, `rtmpUrl`, and `streamKey`, which you will use in your encoder.

    <Callout kind="info">

      
      Setting `record` to `true` enables live recording. With `record` set to `false`, the stream is ephemeral and not saved. Example RTMP endpoints from legacy setups include `rtmp://rc-ingest.in.videograph.ai/rec` (recording) and `rtmp://ingest.in.videograph.ai/live` (non-recording). These are examples only.
      
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your encoder" icon="settings">

    Configure your encoder to push RTMP using the `rtmpUrl` and `streamKey` returned by the API.

    <CodeGroup tabs="encoder-config">
```yaml
rtmp:
  url: "rtmp://INGEST_ENDPOINT_FROM_API"
  streamKey: "STREAM_KEY_FROM_API"
video:
  codec: h264
  bitrate: 4500k
audio:
  codec: aac
  bitrate: 128k
```
    </CodeGroup>

    Save the configuration in your encoder.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start streaming and verify status" icon="play-circle">

    Start streaming from your encoder.  
    In your Videograph dashboard or via API, verify that the stream is receiving data and has transitioned to a `live` state.

    <Callout kind="info">

      
      Status updates appear shortly after the first RTMP packets arrive.
      
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get and test the playback URL" icon="monitor">

    Retrieve the `playbackUrl` from the API response or your dashboard.  
    It is an HLS URL that your player can fetch immediately after the stream becomes active.

    Open the playback URL in your browser or your player integration.

## What Videograph does

Videograph is a plug-and-play video platform that helps you upload, process, and stream video at scale. You can deliver video on demand (VOD) using adaptive streaming formats or create live streams with built-in ingest, recording, and playback capabilities. All workflows are available through simple APIs and the Videograph dashboard.

Videograph manages the full pipeline:

- Accept video input from uploads, remote URLs, or live protocols.

- Process and package content into optimized renditions.

- Deliver high-quality HLS output ready for web, mobile, and connected devices.

## Core workflow

The same core flow applies to both VOD and live streaming.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload or ingest video" icon="upload" title-type="p">
    For VOD, you can upload files directly or provide a source URL. For live, you create a live stream and connect an RTMP or SRT encoder. Videograph ingests the input into your workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Processing pipeline" icon="settings" title-type="p">
    Videograph transcodes your input into multiple renditions, normalizes audio, and packages output for HLS delivery. Status fields on content and live streams show when assets are ready.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Playback delivery" icon="play-circle" title-type="p">
    Each ready VOD asset or live stream exposes a playback identifier or URL. Use it with any HLS-capable player or Videograph SDK to start streaming.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Environments and workspaces

Videograph organizes all video operations inside workspaces. A workspace contains your VOD assets, live streams, channels, ad configuration, and analytics. API keys and content are always scoped to a single workspace.

Typical patterns include:

- Separate development, staging, and production workspaces.

- Workspace-level roles that govern who can view or manage video.

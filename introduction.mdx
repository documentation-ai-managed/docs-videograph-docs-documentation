## What Videograph provides

Videograph is a plug-and-play platform for uploading, processing, and streaming video. It supports both video on demand (VOD) and live streaming through simple, environment-scoped APIs. You work inside an organization environment, where you create VOD content, run live streams, and generate API credentials.

All operations use the same high-level flow:

- Provide video input (file upload or remote URL for VOD; RTMP/RTMPS ingest for live).
- Videograph processes the content into adaptive streaming outputs.
- Your application retrieves an HLS playback URL or identifier for distribution.

<Callout kind="info">

  All API calls require Basic authentication using an access token and secret generated for a specific organization environment. For details, see [Authentication & Access Control](/authentication).

</Callout>

## Core workflow

The following steps summarize how VOD and live streaming behave at a high level.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide input" icon="upload" titleType="p">

    For VOD, you create content by supplying a title, a `content` array with at least one source `url`, and optional playback configuration.  
    For live streaming, you create a live stream by specifying fields such as `title`, `region`, and `record`. Videograph returns ingest endpoints (`rtmpUrl`, `rtmpsUrl`) and a `streamKey`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Processing" icon="settings" titleType="p">

    Videograph processes VOD inputs into streamed renditions.  
    For live, once your encoder pushes RTMP or RTMPS input, the stream transitions through statuses such as `Idle` or other initialization states before becoming playable.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Playback" icon="play-circle" titleType="p">

    VOD content exposes a playback identifier when ready.  
    Live streams provide fields such as `playbackUrl` for HLS distribution.

    You can integrate these URLs with any HLS-capable player or with the Web player documented in [Playing Videos (Web & App Integration)](/web-sdk-player).

  </Step>

## Environments and video management

Videograph scopes all assets and API credentials to an organization environment. Each environment contains its own VOD content, live streams, and access tokens. Common patterns include maintaining separate development, staging, and production environments, each with its own keys and data.

## Dashboard overview

The Videograph dashboard lets you manage VOD and live streaming resources for your environment:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Content management" href="/vod-uploading-ingesting" icon="video">

    Upload or ingest VOD assets, monitor processing, and retrieve playback identifiers.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Live streaming" href="/live-stream-basics" icon="cast">

    Create live streams, obtain RTMP or RTMPS ingest URLs, and access playback endpoints.

  </Card>

  <Card title="API credentials" href="/authentication" icon="key">

    Generate environment-scoped access tokens and secrets to authenticate API requests.

  </Card>
</Columns>

## VOD and live at a glance

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Video on Demand" icon="film">

    - Create content by supplying a title, a `content` array of source URLs, and a `playback_policy` list (for example `public` or `signed`).  
    - Wait for Videograph to process renditions.  
    - Use the returned playback identifier with your HLS player.  
    - Start with [Uploading Videos (Dashboard & API)](/vod-uploading-ingesting).

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Live streaming" icon="cast">

    - Create a live stream with `title`, `region`, and `record` settings.  
    - Use the returned `rtmpUrl` or `rtmpsUrl` and `streamKey` to push input from your encoder.  
    - Retrieve the `playbackUrl` for HLS playback once the stream becomes active.  
    - Learn more in [Live Streaming Overview](/live-stream-basics).

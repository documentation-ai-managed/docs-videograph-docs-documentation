title: Uploading Videos (Dashboard & API)
description: >-
  Step-by-step guide for uploading on-demand videos to Videograph using the
  dashboard or the contents API.
---
## Before you start

You upload videos by creating a content object inside your Videograph environment. Each upload is ingested and processed before it becomes playable.

To call the API, you need a valid access token and secret. See [Authentication & Access Control](/authentication).

Supported ingest sources:

- Dashboard file upload

- URL-based ingest through the contents API

## Uploading from the dashboard

Use this method for manual uploads or operator‑driven workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Video on Demand section" icon="monitor" title-type="p">
    In the web dashboard, open the Video on Demand section and choose the option to upload a new video.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a file" icon="file" title-type="p">
    Choose an MP4, MOV, or M4V file from your local machine.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start ingest" icon="play-circle" title-type="p">
    Confirm the upload to begin ingest. Processing starts automatically, and the item becomes playable once ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Uploading via API

This method matches the reference flow for adding and streaming VOD content using a remote media URL.

### Step 1: Obtain an access token

You must authenticate before calling the API. Follow the steps in [Authentication & Access Control](/authentication) to obtain your API access token and secret.

### Step 2: Create content with `POST /video/services/api/v1/contents`

A minimal request includes the following fields:

- `title`: human‑readable name

- `content`: array of media sources, each containing a `url` pointing to the remote file

- `playback_policy`: array defining access rules such as `public`

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Videograph automatically fetches and processes the file from the remote `url`. Use a publicly reachable source such as the Tears of Steel sample below.
</Callout>

<CodeGroup show-lines="true" tabs={[]}>
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/contents \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "content": [
        { "url": "https://d19nx8bm4jzw4h.cloudfront.net/Tears-of-steel.mp4" }
      ],
      "playback_policy": ["public"],
      "title": "Demo Video"
    }'
  ```

  ```javascript
  import fetch from "node-fetch";

  const body = {
    content: [
      { url: "https://d19nx8bm4jzw4h.cloudfront.net/Tears-of-steel.mp4" }
    ],
    playback_policy: ["public"],
    title: "Demo Video"
  };

  const res = await fetch("https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/contents", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "accept": "application/json",
      "content-type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body)
  });

  console.log(await res.json());
  ```

  ```php
  <?php

  $body = [
    "content" => [
      ["url" => "https://d19nx8bm4jzw4h.cloudfront.net/Tears-of-steel.mp4"]
    ],
    "playback_policy" => ["public"],
    "title" => "Demo Video"
  ];

  $ch = curl_init("https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/contents");
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    "accept: application/json",
    "content-type: application/json"
  ]);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($body));

  $response = curl_exec($ch);
  curl_close($ch);

  echo $response;
  ```

  ```python
  import requests

  body = {
      "content": [
          {"url": "https://d19nx8bm4jzw4h.cloudfront.net/Tears-of-steel.mp4"}
      ],
      "playback_policy": ["public"],
      "title": "Demo Video"
  }

  res = requests.post(
      "https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/contents",
      headers={
          "accept": "application/json",
          "content-type": "application/json"
      },
      json=body
  )

  print(res.json())
  ```

  ```java
  import java.net.http.*;
  import java.net.URI;

  var client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
  var body = """
  {
    "content": [
      { "url": "https://d19nx8bm4jzw4h.cloudfront.net/Tears-of-steel.mp4" }
    ],
    "playback_policy": ["public"],
    "title": "Demo Video"
  }
  """;

  var req = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("https://api.videograph.ai/video/services/api/v1/contents"))
    .header("accept", "application/json")
    .header("content-type", "application/json")
    .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(body))
    .build();

  var res = client.send(req, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
  System.out.println(res.body());
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Check the response

A successful request returns an object containing identifiers such as `contentId` and playback details. The status typically appears as `Preparing` until processing is complete.

<Callout kind="success" collapsed="false">
  Once the content status becomes `Ready`, playback URLs and additional metadata become available for use in your applications.
</Callout>

## When to use each method

- Use **dashboard upload** for manual, one‑off, or operator workflows.

- Use **API ingest** for automated pipelines or when content is already hosted at a remote URL.

After ingest and processing complete, the content is ready for playback and management across your environment.
